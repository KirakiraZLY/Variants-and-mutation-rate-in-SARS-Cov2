# Week 8

## 1. Data Cleaning   
1. Deleted those data with 0 mutations
2. Deleted those data in SNP change with duplicated values.

3. After omitting, 8320141 data left.

## 2. Convergence
![L452R,BA.4](https://github.com/KirakiraZLY/Variants-and-mutation-rate-in-SARS-Cov2/blob/main/Img/Week10/L452R%2CBA.4.png?raw=true)
![L452R,BA.5](https://github.com/KirakiraZLY/Variants-and-mutation-rate-in-SARS-Cov2/blob/main/Img/Week10/L452R%2CBA.5.png?raw=true)
BA.4 appeared in Japan, while BA.5 occured in South Africa. Both variants showed the same mutation in different environments, showing the convergence strength.   
## 3. Potentially advantage aa_change
![D614G,Delta](https://github.com/KirakiraZLY/Variants-and-mutation-rate-in-SARS-Cov2/blob/main/Img/Week10/D614G%2CDelta.png?raw=true)
![D614G,BA.5.2.1](https://github.com/KirakiraZLY/Variants-and-mutation-rate-in-SARS-Cov2/blob/main/Img/Week10/D614G%2CBA.5.2.1.png?raw=true)
D614G was almost fitted while overcompeted by some other variants and frequency dropped(as Delta was defeated by Omicron). However, in Omicron variants, D614G rose again, showing its appearance is not from hitchhiking, but adaptive evolution.   
**So how strong is this adaptive evolution?**
