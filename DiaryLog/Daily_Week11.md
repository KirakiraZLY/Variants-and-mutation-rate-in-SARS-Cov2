# Week 11

## 1. What happened with the stratification of data?

In this plot, we can see that there are many n>50 before 2022-01, which looks weird. If this happened due to the limitation of detection condition?

It seems no? But we don't know why then.   

## 2. Non-syn and Syn number change during time

![syn](https://github.com/KirakiraZLY/Variants-and-mutation-rate-in-SARS-Cov2/blob/main/Img/Week11/Num_of_Syn_with_date.png?raw=true)
It seems that both mutate gradually?   
Then do dn/ds test!!!

## 3. alternative of dn/ds
Since we don't have the gene sequencial data, we cannot make count on number of syn or non-syn sites. 

### zly formula
