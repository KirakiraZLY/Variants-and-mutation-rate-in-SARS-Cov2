## Week 4
- [x] count_S synonmous   
- [x] AA substitution
- [ ] L452R, F486V, R493Q
### 2022.9.18
By checking the plot below, I found that most significant VOC skal vare:   
**VOC Alpha GRY, VOC Delta GK, VOC Omicron GRA.**  

P.S. Before 2021.6, there were many variants had no identified name, so all were NA.   
In CDC article, VOC are dragged to be: 
> Omicron(B.1.1.529, BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, BA.3, BA.4, BA.5)

### 2022.9.19   
To get all the variants with AA Substitutions == "Spike_E484Q"
![E484Q](https://github.com/KirakiraZLY/Variants-and-mutation-rate-in-SARS-Cov2/blob/main/Img/Spike_E484Q_Synonmous.png?raw=true)   
**It's interesting that E484Q only appeared from 2021-1 to 2022-1, before Omicron.**   
***So what are the major differences between Omicron and previous variants?***   
*Guess: E484Q's dissappear is correlated to the advantage of Omicron, or to the escaping from immunity?*
   
**Computing the slope**  
Using linear regression:<center> $y=WX+b$</center>    
Find out that:   
- For VOC Alpha GRY,  the slope is: 1.087e-02
- For VOC Delta GK,   the slope is: 1.289e-02
- For VOC Omicron GRA,the slope is: 4.326e-02
   
By making plot, we can see that: 
![mutationRate](https://github.com/KirakiraZLY/Variants-and-mutation-rate-in-SARS-Cov2/blob/main/Img/MutationRateOfDifferentVariants.png?raw=true)   
It shows that, most variants have positive slope of mutation, meaning the mutation numbers are increasing. And Omicron is more significant, that it has a higher slope, showing that the mutating speed of Omicron is the fastest.   
*While some even have decreasing mutation numbers? Hvorfor?*   
I firstly guessed it would be that something wrong in data collecting, but it doesn't make sense to wrong for so many data.
   
**GC Content**    
It shows that the stability of RNA of different variants are not changed significantly,    
*so the different mutation rate would come from other reasons.*
